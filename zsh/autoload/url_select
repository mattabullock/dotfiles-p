# `url_select` - utility to select url from iterm_session_history
# this is f-ugly hack to workaround the fact that I can't use a keyboard shortcut
# to open a url in iTerm2. And I really don't want to use tmux for that one feature.
#
# nb: - requires `brew install extract_url urlview`
#     - see `iterm_session_history` for the bulk for the fugliness.
function url_select() {
  # nb: 2>/dev/null is cause extract_url doesn't like being used without a tty (because of |head)
  # and i'm unable to see an option to disable it (--list isn't sufficient)
  iterm_session_history | extract_url --list --text --quoted 2>/dev/null | head -n 10 | urlview
